### 1️⃣ Sliding Window

This folder contains solutions for problems utilizing the **sliding window** technique, including:



---

### 2️⃣ Dynamic Programming

This folder includes solutions covering various types of **Dynamic Programming** strategies:

✅ **Memoization** (Top-down DP)  
✅ **Tabulation** (Bottom-up DP)  
✅ **1D DP**  
✅ **2D DP**  
✅ **State Compression DP**  
✅ **Subset/Knapsack DP**  
✅ **DP on Strings**  
✅ **DP on Subsequences**
